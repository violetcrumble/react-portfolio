        I've been in the web development field for over 15 years. I've done
        freelance web design, worked at small agencies, and at large
        corporations. I'm currently a frontend software developer in a corporate
        environment.

        I got into web design and development as a dorky teenager, during the
        late 90s. I happened upon a print issue of the now-defunct{" "}

        account, I started to experiment. I quickly fell in love with web
        design, since it allowed me to use both the creative and technical sides
        of my brain. Soon after high school, I decided to go to{" "}

          The Art Institute of Atlanta

        Immediately after I graduated from the Art Institute, I picked up a job
        at BellSouth Advertising and Publishing (now known as yellowpages.com.)
        I started out doing both Graphic Design and HTML/CSS for small
        brochure-type websites. These sites could be about anything from
        plumbers to lawyers to clowns - pretty much any business you would find
        in a phone book.{" "}

        It was a pretty sweet gig for a while, but six years later, it was time
        to move on. It was time for a change. In a strange twist of fate, I
        happened upon a web development position at{" "}

        Reloacting to Knoxville and working at Clayton was a great decision!
        Here I am, ten years later, still enjoying all of the changes. I
        actually get to experiment with new web development techniques at my
        job. Not to mention, I have a lot more spare time because I don't have
        to sit in traffic as much. This allows me to spend more time withe my
